DEPENDENCIES-


INTRODUCTION-

This tool helps for comparing the ML Capability in intent recognition for the platforms Kore.ai, Luis.ai and API.ai.

PREPARATION OF DATA-
1. Mention the Intents and the train data to be created in the Intent.csv file. While entering data , please follow the format as it is in Intent.csv
2. Mention the test data along with utterance classification ( i.e Positive/Negative/Spell Errors etc) in ML_TestData.csv. Here it is important to give the classification names properly as mentioned in the ML_TestData.csv sheet, with the necessary capitalization. 

HOW TO CONFIGURE-


In the configBot.py File, follow the mentioned steps to get all the necessary tokens and populate them.

HOW TO RUN-
Use Python 3.5

For Easy use:
Linux: ./run.sh

More customisable use:

1. Create a virtual env for this tool, if not already present.
     $ virtualenv --python=python3 venv/ # creates venv
     $ source venv/bin/activate          # uses venv
2. If this is your first time running the tool, do this.
     $ pip install --upgrade pip
     $ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
3. To create a bot, upload training data, and test it and store results all at once, do
     $ "python pipeline.py"
4. To do these steps separately,
     $ python createIntent.py
     $ python read.py
     $ python tabulate.py

Do not give spaces in bot name. It is not tested with spaces.
Note that kore platform access token expires in finite time. so if you plan to run the testing at a later time, please update the token in config.py (not configBot.py)

Currently it is possible to configure the tool to enable or disable running against Luis and DialogFlow, via configBot.py

HOW TO EVALUATE THE RESULTS-

1. The Results sheet has the status pass or fail depending on the intent identified matched with expected intent. 
2. The Summary sheet shows Precision, Recall, F Measure and Accuracy Values for all the three platforms.
3. The IndividualIntents sheet shows the True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives for all the three platforms for individual tasks.

NOTES- Certain limitations are to be noted:
	a. Maximum number of Intents that can be created in Luis.AI are 12.
	b. Maximum number of endpoint hits for Luis.AI are 1000 hits per month for an account(For all the bots in the account together)
	c. Maximum number of agents that can be created in API.AI are 15


Configuration for API.ai -:

First of all create a new bot(referred as agent in api.ai). Press on the gear icon on the left next to the bot name. Copy the Developer_Access_Token.

#In the URL of the page, copy the bot id next to 'editAgent/' .


#Configuration for Luis.ai -:

#As soon as you login into the Luis website, press on My Keys. In this page, copy the Programmatic API key and paste it within the keys in subscriptionToken.

#Configuration for Kore.ai -:

#Enter the name of the environment for which the Benchmark tool needs to be run.  

KorePlatform="https://bots.kore.ai"
